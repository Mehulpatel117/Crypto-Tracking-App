Crypto Tracker App | React.js, API Integration

Developed a real-time cryptocurrency tracking application using React.js, fetching live market data from a third-party API (e.g., CoinGecko).

Implemented features like price charts, search functionality, and portfolio simulation with dynamic UI updates.

Utilized React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and Axios for API requests.

Styled components using CSS-in-JS (Styled-components/Tailwind) for a responsive and modern interface.
